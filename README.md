# destin--AI-chat-bot
A chat bot that helps you find information about other cities around the world. It can be used by people working in the tech industry who want to move to a new location. They can ask to find images, crime statistics, population, salaries, and more information about that city or country.

This was created at the Global AI Hackathon held in Toronto and sponsored by Microsoft. Our team, Destin, finished 2nd place in the event. For this project, Microsoft's API LUIS (Language Understanding Intelligent Service) was used. Our team (Destin) built a custom LUIS application to process what the user was saying and extract the subject (entity) and purpose (intent) of the statement. Since there are different ways of expressing the same thing (utterances), we had to enumerate them in the LUIS API.

Thus, we did not build the machine learning models ourselves, but used Microsoft's API LUIS instead. Overall, it was a great learning experience. Also, if you would like to use this chat-bot, you would have to download these files, along with Node js and the Microsoft Bot 
Framework Emulator. Currently, our team has not implemented a web solution for this bot. Hopefully it can be implemented in the future.
