# destin--AI-chat-bot
A chat-bot that helps you find information about other cities around the world. It can be used by people working in the tech industry who want to move to a new location. They can ask to find images of the city/country, crime statistics, population, salaries, and more information about that city or country.

This was created at the Global AI Hackathon held in Toronto and sponsored by Microsoft. Our team, Destin, finished 2nd place in the event. For this project, our team used Microsoft's API LUIS (Language Understanding Intelligent Service), integrated with JavaScript using NodeJS (see code in [app.js](https://github.com/roshan2M/destin--AI-chat-bot/blob/master/app.js)). Our team (Destin) built a custom LUIS application to process the user's text and extract the subject (entity) and purpose (intent) of the statement. Since there are different ways of expressing the same thing (utterances), we had to enumerate them in the LUIS API. We could not implement a Web solution in time, so it was implemented using the Micrsoft Bot Framework Emulator instead.

Overall, a great learning experience! Having never worked with JavaScript, it was both fun and frustrating at the same. In the future, I plan to use this knowledge to create my own chat-bot with a Web solution.
